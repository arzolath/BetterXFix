# vxX
(A fork of BetterTwitFix)
Basic flask server that serves fixed twitter video embeds to desktop discord by using either the X API or Youtube-DL to grab tweet video information. This also automatically embeds the first link in the text of non video tweets (API Only)

Additionally, vxX has a 'none' cache option, which is intended to be used behind a service like CloudFlare. vxx.com currently runs with this option enabled to protect user privacy. 
## How to use the hosted version

Just replace x.com with vxx.com on the link to the tweet! `https://x.com/Arzolath/status/1698924907847876628` -> `https://vxx.com/Arzolath/status/1698924907847876628`
